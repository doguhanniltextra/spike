# ADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-07-22
- Tags: Security, Operations, HA, Simplicity, SPIRE

## Context and Problem Statement

A proposal was made to add a lock/unlock mechanism to SPIKE Nexus, allowing 
operators to globally lock the system (*e.g., via a CLI or API*) to prevent all 
secret and policy operations except unlock/status. The lock state would be 
persisted in the backing store and enforced across all Nexus instances, with the 
root key zeroed out in memory. This was intended to provide a system-wide freeze 
for security or operational reasons.

However, this approach introduces significant complexity, especially in 
high-availability (*HA*) and distributed deployments. It also creates new 
operational and security risks and may not align with SPIFFE-native best 
practices.

## Decision Drivers

* Simplicity and maintainability of the **SPIKE** architecture
* Security model alignment with SPIFFE/SPIRE
* Operational clarity and reliability in HA/distributed setups
* Avoiding unnecessary complexity and performance overhead
* Leveraging existing SPIRE mechanisms for system-level access control

## Considered Options

1. Implement a lock/unlock mechanism in SPIKE Nexus (*persisted in the backing 
   store, enforced at API level*)
2. Use SPIRE registration entry management (delete/disable Nexus entries to "lock" the system)
3. Rely on infrastructure-level controls (e.g., scaling down Nexus, process management)
4. Do nothing (status quo)

## Decision

**SPIKE Nexus will NOT implement a lock/unlock API or CLI feature.**

Instead, operators are recommended to achieve system-level locking by either:

1. **Managing SPIRE registration entries**: Removing or disabling the relevant 
   SPIRE registration entries for SPIKE Nexus will immediately block all 
   authenticated API access, effectively freezing the system in a secure, 
   auditable, and SPIFFE-native way.
2. **Using infrastructure-level controls**: Scaling down the Nexus deployment, 
   stopping Nexus processes, or otherwise restricting access at the 
   infrastructure level are also valid and supported approaches.

These methods are the supported and recommended ways to "lock" the system. 
No additional lock/unlock API or CLI subcommand will be provided by 
**SPIKE Nexus** at this time.

A sample script for SPIRE registration entry management:

```sh
SPIFFE_ID="spiffe://spike.ist/spike/nexus/..."
ENTRY_ID=$(spire-server entry show --spiffeID "$SPIFFE_ID" \
  | awk '/Entry ID/ {print $NF}')
if [ -z "$ENTRY_ID" ]; then
  echo "No entry found for SPIFFE ID: $SPIFFE_ID"
  exit 1
fi
if spire-server entry delete --entryID "$ENTRY_ID"; then
  echo "Successfully deleted entry with SPIFFE ID: $SPIFFE_ID"
else
  echo "Failed to delete entry with SPIFFE ID: $SPIFFE_ID"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Rationale

* **Simplicity:** Avoids introducing distributed consensus, state management, 
  and API enforcement logic for a rarely used feature.
* **Security:** SPIRE registration entries are the root of trust; removing them 
  is the most secure and auditable way to block access. Infrastructure controls 
  are also robust and well-understood.
* **Operational Clarity:** The lock/unlock state is unambiguous and enforced 
  at the trust boundary or infrastructure, not in application logic.
* **HA/Scaling:** No need for all Nexus instances to coordinate or poll a 
  shared lock state, avoiding performance and reliability issues.
* **SPIFFE-Native:** Embraces the SPIFFE/SPIRE model for access control, 
  rather than reinventing similar mechanisms in SPIKE.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Simpler, more maintainable codebase
* No performance or reliability impact on Nexus API
* Locking is enforced at the trust boundary (SPIRE), not in application logic
* Immediate effect across all Nexus instances
* No risk of partial lock or split-brain scenarios
* Aligns with SPIFFE-native best practices

### Negative

* Locking/unlocking requires SPIRE server access (*not just SPIKE operator 
  privileges*)---This can be seen as a "positive" consequence, too, as it
  provides an additional level of isolation and security.
* No fine-grained or temporary lock state within SPIKE Nexus itself
* Some operational scenarios (e.g., "pause but keep registration") are not 
  directly supported

## Alternatives Considered

### Implementing Lock/Unlock in SPIKE Nexus

- **Rejected** due to complexity, risk of split-brain, performance overhead, 
  and operational ambiguity in HA setups.
- Would require distributed consensus or polling and add significant code and 
  operational burden.

### Infrastructure-Level Controls

- Scaling down Nexus or killing processes is effective but "nuclear" and may 
  disrupt monitoring, logging, or other integrations.

### Direct DB Manipulation

- Not recommended or supported, but possible for those with privileged access. 
  Not considered a safe or auditable approach.

## Decision Outcome

This ADR documents the decision to rely on SPIRE registration entry management 
or infrastructure-level controls for system-level "locking" of **SPIKE Nexus**, 
and to avoid implementing a separate lock/unlock API or CLI feature in 
**SPIKE Nexus** itself. 

This decision may be revisited if/when a true **SPIKE Nexus** HA topology is 
implemented and operational experience suggests a different approach is 
warranted.
